/**
 * This class serves as a base event class for all extensions of the Android container, when we want to perform some
 * action after container as such is configured.
 *
 * It serves as an extension point for all extensions to be configured right after container is configured but before
 * Android Bridge is about to initialize. It is a gap where container extension can be hooked.
